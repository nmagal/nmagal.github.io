### Modality Drop For Co-learning

We find that by using aggressive modality dropout we are able to reverse negative co-learning (NCL) to positive co-learning (PCL). Aggressive modality dropout can be used to ’prep’ a multimodal model for unimodal deployment, and dramatically increases model performance during negative co-learning, where during some experiments we saw a 20% gain in accuracy.
